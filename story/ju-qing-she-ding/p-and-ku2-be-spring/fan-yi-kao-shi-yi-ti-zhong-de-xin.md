Dear Miyu,

I still remember the time when we first met last September. In the classroom, the noise in physics class seemed to have nothing to do with you, and you indulged yourself in the ever-changing and exquisite universe you created. For the first time, I found that there was such an exciting observation object beside me. Then our story began.

Soon, I discovered that the characters in the universe you had piled up in your imagination were different parts of your soul. I greedily observed the actions and words of these characters, trying to understand you more deeply. The outcomes of the observation were very interesting. And in the end, I also became a member of this illusory universe, the "observer".

Observation and creation are two means of interacting with others. Upon meeting, they form a system that consumes each other's energy. The object of observation is the created universe, and creation requires observation too. This is the rule by which fate binds us. Therefore, for our relationship's long-term and stable continuity, puzzles and keys have become how we absorb nutrition from the outside world. Coincidentally, your name is the puzzle and mine is the key.

I will never say goodbye to you, because we are born to be paired with each other. I am free from the outside world's disgust, unhappiness, and disappointment when we are together. Nobody can accurately describe the mixed feelings in my heart when I get along with you. It's like, but not limited to, scruples caused by basing everything on you. As you can see, the letter is also encrypted with a chemistry-related cipher. I believe that the decryption process is not difficult for you. **After all, this letter's content does not help solve the puzzle. Also, the password to open the gift box is "He Left Again" exactly.** I hope you will like the present I brought you, which I bought in the neighborhood.

May our friendship be unbreakable.

Miyue
